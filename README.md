# EVM-Token-Sniping-Bot  These are some the files I used to create a crude sniping bot for EVM's. I didn't spend very much time trying to explain the code here,
but I wanted to share it just in case it gives somebody a little bit of insight for a project they may be trying to build. This was built in Node JS and the contracts
were deployed using truffle. https://youtu.be/62f757RVEvU THis video is what I used to understand truffle and deploy it(EatTheBlocks is a good resource).
The scripts that start with a B (Bonnie & Bo) are BSC scripts for sniping. Martha & Mathew are for Matic network. The Hqbsc and Hqmatic are used to configure
the smart contract before the snipe. I included the package.json so you can get all the necassary packages with node install. This script can only detect Liqudity
add Tx's in the mempool and send tx's to get in, in the same block.The NFT token scan writes new tokens to a .txt file.
These smart contracts and scripts can work on any EVM as long as you have a node provider. Good Luck.

We're building a community of people who enjoy investing in web3 and enjoy doing analysis, reach out about it to me on twitter @PopsRoll , 
discord & website will be up soon. Going to try a lot of new things with this community.
